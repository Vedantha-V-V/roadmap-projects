# Roadmap.sh Learning Projects

Welcome! This repository is a personal learning journal where I’m building hands-on projects while following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) guides. The goal is to learn by doing — applying each concept through code and gradually building a strong foundation across the **Frontend** and **Backend** paths.

---

## Overview 

Rather than passively consuming tutorials or articles, I’m focusing on building real-world projects aligned with the skills and milestones outlined in roadmap.sh. Each folder in this repo corresponds to a major domain in web development.

This is a long-term journey where I will be:

- Starting with the **Frontend**.
- Adding **Backend** projects in parallel as I advance.
