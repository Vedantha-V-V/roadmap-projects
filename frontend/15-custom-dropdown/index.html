        <p>Python</p>
        <p>Everything Is an Object:
            In Python, everything — even functions and classes — is an object.</p>
        <p>Whitespace Matters (Literally):
            Python uses indentation (whitespace) to define code blocks. Unlike most languages that use {} or begin/end, Python forces readable code.
            Forgetting a space can crash your code!</p>

        <p>Java</p>
        <p>Java is not an Acronym:
            It was named after Java coffee, reflecting the creators' love for caffeine. Its original name was Oak.</p>
        <p>Java introduced built-in garbage collection to mainstream programming. This means developers don’t manually free memory, which reduces memory leaks (but not entirely!).</p>

        <p>Rust</p>
        <p>Rust guarantees memory safety through ownership and borrowing — without needing a garbage collector.This makes it super fast and safe — ideal for systems programming.</p>
        <p>Rust's abstractions (like iterators) compile down to machine code with no runtime overhead.
            You get high-level code with C-like performance.</p>

        <p>JavaScript</p>
        <p>JavaScript was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich in 1995 — originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, then JavaScript (confusingly).</p>
        <p>JavaScript is single-threaded but uses event loops and callbacks (and now async/await) to handle concurrency.
            .This is how Node.js handles many requests efficiently without threads.</p>

        <p>PHP</p>
        <p>PHP Originally Stood for "Personal Home Page",It started as a simple tool to track Rasmus Lerdorf’s online resume. Now it's one of the most widely used server-side scripting languages.</p>
        <p>Loose Typing Can Be Weird, PHP allows bizarre comparisons due to its loose type system.</p>
